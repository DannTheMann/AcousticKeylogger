# Acoustic Keylogger

The bulk of the dissertation went here with several learning models applied to an acoustic keylogging device. 

This is an Android Application developed in AndroidStudio that aims to utilise a smartphones microphone to determine keystrokes from a keyboard. 

This was a fun project. =)
